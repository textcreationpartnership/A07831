            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THe wiſe Creator of the univerſall Globe, hath placed a golden meane betwixt two extreames: I meane the temperate Zones, betwixt the hote and cold; and every Creature, that participates of Heavens bleſſings, with in the Compaſſe of that golden meane, is made moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10593:7"/>apt and fit, for man to uſe, who likewiſe by that wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is ordained to be the Lord of all. This globe may be his glaſſe, to teach him how to uſe modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſcretion, both in his actions and intentions. The wiſe man ſayes, give mee neither riches nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; why? Riches might make him proud like Nebuchadnezar, and poverty deſpaire, like Iobs wife; but a meane betweene both.<note place="margin">Vſe of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives.</note> So it is likewiſe in the uſe of Vegetatives, that which hath too much Heate or too much Colde, is ſaid to be venenum, ſo in the uſe of ſenſitives, all thoſe Animals, of what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus or ſpecies ſoever they be, if they participate of heate or cold, in the ſuperlative, are ſaid to be <hi>Inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca naturae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fiſh poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous about the Iſle of Sall.</note> as in ſome Fiſhes about the Iſle of Sall, and thoſe Ilandes adjoyninge, betweene the Tropickes, their participatinge of heate and cold, in the ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is made moſt manifeſt, one of which, poyſoned a whole Ships company that eate of it. And ſo it is in Vipers, Toades, and Snakes, that have heate or cold in the ſuperlative degree.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Creatures that participate of heate and cold in a meane, are beſt and holſomeſt: And ſo it is in the choyſe of love, the middell Zone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two extreames is beſt, and it is therefore called <hi>Zona temperata,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zona tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perata, the Golden meane.</note> and is in the golden meane; and all thoſe Landes lying under that Zone, moſt requiſite and fitt for habitation. In Coſmography, the two extreames are called, the one
<hi>Torrida Zona,</hi> lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Tropickes, the other <hi>Frigida Zona,</hi> lying neare the Poles: all the landes lying under, either of theſe Zones, by reaſon, they doe participate too
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10593:7"/>much of heate or cold, are very inconvenient, and are accompanied with many evils. And allthough I am not of opinion with Ariſtotle, that the landes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Torrida Zona,</hi> are alltogether uninhabited, I my ſelfe having beene ſo neare the equinoctiall line, that I have had the Sunn for my Zenith, and ſeene proofe to the contrary, yet cannot I deny, but that it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with many inconveniences, as that Fiſh and Fleſh both will taint in thoſe partes, notwithſtanding the uſe of Salt which cannot be wanting there, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by natures hande-worke.<note place="margin">Salt aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth under the Tropicks.</note> And that is a great hinderance to the ſettinge forth and ſupply of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the very Sinewes of a floriſhing Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Then barrenneſſe, cauſed through want of raines, for in moſt of thoſe partes of the world it is ſeldome accuſtomed to raine, untill the time of the Tornathees (as the Portingals phraſe is, who lived there) and then it will raine about 40. dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Raine <hi>40.</hi> dayes about Auguſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer and the Line.</note> which moiſture ſerveth to fructify the earth for all the yeare after, duringe which time is ſeene no raine at all: the heate and cold, and length of day and night, being much alike, with little difference. And theſe raines are cauſed by the turning of the windes, which elſe betweene the Tropickes, doe blow Trade, that is allwayes one way. For next the Tropicke of Cancer it is conſtantly North-Eaſt, and next the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke of Capricorne it is Southweſt; ſo that the windes comming from the Poles, do keepe the aire in thoſe partes coole, and make it temperate and the partes habitable, were it not for thoſe and other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:10593:8"/> This <hi>Torrida Zona</hi> is good for Graſhoppers: and <hi>Zona Temperata</hi> for the Ant and Bee. But <hi>Frigida Zona</hi> good for neither, as by lamentable experience of Captaine Davis Fate, is manifeſt, who in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Nortweſt paſſage for the Eaſt India trade was frozen to death.<note place="margin">Capt. Davis froze to death.</note> And thefore for <hi>Frigida Zona,</hi> I agree with Ariſtotle, that it is unfit for habitation: and I know by the Courſe of the caeleſtiall globe, that in Groeneland many Degrees ſhort of the Pole Articke, <note place="margin">Groene Land too cold for habitation.</note> the place is too cold, by reaſon of the Sunns abſence almoſt ſix monethes, and the land under the continuall power of the froſt; which thinge many more Navigators have prooved with pittifull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their wintringe there, as appeareth by the hiſtory, I thinke, they will not venture to winter there againe for an India mine.</p>
                  <p>And as it is found by our Nation under the Pole Articke, ſo it is likewiſe to be found under the Antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke Pole, yet what hazard will not an induſtrious minde, and couragious ſpirit undergoe, according to that of the Poe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. <hi>Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad Indos per mare pauperiem fugiens, per ſaxa, per ignes.</hi> And all to gett and hord up like the Ant and the Bee, and yet as Salomon ſaith, hee cannot tell whether a foole or a wiſe man ſhall enjoy it. Therefore let us leave theſe two extreames, with their inconveniences, and indeavour to finde out this golden meane, ſo free from any one of them. Behold the ſecret wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of allmighty God, and love unto, our Salomon to raiſe a man of a lardge hart, full of worthy abilities to be the Index or Loadſtarre, that doth point out
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10593:8"/>unto the Engliſh Nation, with eaſe and comfort how to finde it out. And this the noble minded Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Sir Ferdinando Gorges Knight, <note place="margin">Sir Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Gorges the originall cauſe of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge New England.</note> zealous for the glory of God, the honor of his Majeſty, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the weale publicke, hath done a great worke for the good of his Country.</p>
                  <p>And herein this, the wondrous wiſedome and love of God, is ſhewne, by ſending to the place his Miniſter, to ſweepe away by heapes the Salvages, <note place="margin">The Salvages dyed of the Plague.</note> and alſo giving him length of dayes, to ſee the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed after his enterpriſe was begunne, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This judicious Gentleman, hath found this goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den meane, to be ſcituated about the middle of thoſe two extreames, and for directions you may proove it thus: Counting the ſpace betweene the Line and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Poles, in true proportion, you ſhall finde it to be 90. Degrees: then muſt we finde the meane, to be neare unto the Center of 90. and that is about 45. Degrees, and then incline unto the Sotherne ſide of that Center, properly for the benefit of heate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membringe that <hi>Sol &amp; Homo generat hominem;</hi> and then keepe us on that fame ſide, and ſee what Land is to be found there, and we ſhall eaſily diſcerne that new Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is on the South ſide of that Center.</p>
                  <p>For that Country doth beginne her boundes at 40. Degrees of Northerne latitude,
<note place="margin">New Engl. is placed in the golden meane.</note> and endes at 45. Degrees of the ſame latitude, and doth participate of heate and cold indifferently, but is oppreſſed with neither: and therefore may be truly ſayd to be within the compaſſe of that golden meane, moſt apt and fit
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10593:9"/>for habitation and generation, being placed by All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God the great Creator, under that Zone, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Zona temperata,</hi> and is therefore moſt fitt for the generation and habitation of our Engliſh nation, of all other, who are more neere neighbours to the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Pole, whoſe Land lyeth betweene 50. and 54. Degrees of the ſelfeſame latitude: now this new Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land though it be nearer to the line, then that old England by 10. Degrees of latitude, <note place="margin">New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>10.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees neerer the line then old England.</note> yet doth not this exceede that other in heate or cold, by reaſon of the cituation of it; for as the Coaſt lyeth, being circular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Northeaſt and Southweſt, oppoſite towards the Sunnes riſinge, which makes his courſe over the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, it can have litle or no reflecting, heat of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames, by reaſon of the continuall motion of the waters, makinge the aire there the cooler and the conſtanter: ſo that for the temperature of the Climent, ſweetneſſe of the aire, fertility of the Soile, and ſmall number of the Salvages (which might ſeeme a rubb in the way off an effeminate minde,) this Country of new England is by all judicious men, accounted the principall part of all America, for habitation and the commodiouſneſſe of the Sea, Ships there not being ſubject to wormes, as in Virginea and other places, and not to be paraleld in all Chriſtendome.

                  <p>IN the yeare ſince the incarnation of Chriſt, 1622. it was my chance to be landed in the parts of New England, where I found two ſortes of people, the one Chriſtians, the other Infidels, theſe I found moſt full of humanity, and more friendly then the other: as ſhall hereafter be made apparant in Dew-Courſe, by their ſeverall actions from time to time, whileſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among them After my arrivall in thoſe partes, I endeavoured by all the wayes and meanes that I could to find out from what people or nation, the Natives of

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10593:10"/>the Tropicke of Cancer, for they doe ſtill retaine the memory of ſome of the Starres one that part of thea Caeleſtiall Globe, as the North-ſtarre, which with them is called Maſke, for Maſke in their Language ſignifieth a Beare, and they doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the windes into eight partes, and it ſeemes ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, have had ſome litterature amongſt them, which time hath Cancelled and worne cut of uſe, and where as it hath beene the opinion of ſome men, which ſhall be nameles, that the Natives of New-England may proceede from the race of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and come from Tartaria into thoſe partes, over the frozen Sea.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10593:11"/>how ſhould they doe for Fuell, to keepe them at night from freezing to death, which will not bee had in ſuch a place, but it may perhaps be granted that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this Country might originally come of the ſcattred Trojans: For after that Brutus, who was the forth from Aneas, left Latium upon the conflict had with the Latines, (where although hee gave them a great overthrow, <note place="margin">Why Brutus left Latium.</note> to the Slaughter of their grand Captaine and many other of the Heroes of Latium, yet hee held it more ſafety to depart unto ſome other place, and people, then by ſtaying to runne the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of an unquiet life or doubtfull Conqueſt, which as hiſtory maketh mention hee performed;) this people were diſperſed there is no queſtion, but the people that lived with him, by reaſon of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the Graecians and Latines, had a mixed language that participated of both, whatſoever was that which was proper to their owne nation at firſt; I know not for this is commonly ſeene where 2. nations traffique together, the one indevouring to underſtand the others meaning makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both many times ſpeak a mixed language, <note place="margin">Two Nations meetinge make a mixt language.</note> as is approoved by the Natives, of New England, through the coveteous deſire they have, to commerce with our nation, and wee with them.</p>
                  <p>And when Brutus did depart from Latium, we doe not finde that his whole number went with him at once, or arrived at one place; and being put to Sea might encounter with a ſtorme, that would carry them out of ſight of Land, and then they might ſayle God knoweth whether, and ſo might be put upon this

                  <p>And why ſhould any man thinke, the Natives of New England, to be the gleanings of all Nations, onely becauſe by the pronunciation and termination their words ſeeme to trench upon ſeverall languages, when time hath not furniſhed him with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof, the thinge that muſt induce a man of reaſonabe capacity to any maner of conjecture, of

                  <p>REputation is ſuch a thing, that it keepes many men in awe, even amongſt Civilized nations, and is very much ſtood upon: it is (as one hath very well noted) the awe of great men and of Kings, and ſince I have obſerved it, to be maintained amongſt Salvage people, I cannot chuſe but give an inſtance thereof in this treatiſe, to confirme the common receaved opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Sachem or Sagamore of Sagus made choiſe, (when hee came to mans eſtate) of a Lady of noble diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Daughter to Papaſiquineo: the Sachem or Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more of the territories neare Merrimack River a man of the beſt note and eſtimation in all thoſe parts (and as my Countryman M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Wood declares in his proſpect) a great Nigromancer, <note place="margin">A marriage.</note> this Lady the younge Sachem with the conſent &amp; good liking of her father marries, and takes for his wife. Great entertainement, hee and his receaved in thoſe parts at her fathers hands, where they weare feſted in the beſt manner that might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, according to the Cuſtome of their nation, with reveling, &amp; ſuch other ſolemnities as is uſuall amongſt them. The ſolemnity being ended, Papaſiquineo cauſes a ſelected number of his men to waite upon his Daughter home: into thoſe parts that did properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ber Lord, and huſband, where the attendants had entertainment by the Sachem of Sagus and his Countrymen: the ſolemnity being ended, the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants were gratified.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the new married Lady had a great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10593:20"/>deſire to ſee her father, and her native country, from whence ſhee came, her Lord willing to pleaſure her, &amp; not deny her requeſt (amongſt them) thought to be reaſonable commanded a ſelected number of his owne men to conduct his Lady to her Father; wherwith great reſpect they brought her: and having feaſted there a while, returned to their owne country againe, leaving the Lady to continue there at her owne pleaſure, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt her friends, and old acquaintance: where ſhee paſſed away the time for a while: and in the end deſired to returne to her Lord againe. Her father the old Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiquineo having notice of her intent, <note place="margin">An ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſent from Papaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quineo to his ſoone in law, a Sachem.</note> ſent ſome of his men on ambaſſage to the younge Sachem, his ſonne in law, to let him underſtand that his daughter was not willing, to abſent her ſelfe from his company any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; &amp; therfore (as the meſſengers had in charge) deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the younge Lord to ſend a convoy for her: but hee ſtanding upon tearmes of honor, &amp; the maintaining of his reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, returnd to his father in law this anſwere that when ſhe departed from him, hee cauſed his men to waite upon her to her fathers territories, as it did become him: but now ſhee had an intend to returne, it did become her father, to ſend her back with a convoy of his own people: &amp; that it ſtood not with his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make himſelf or his men ſo ſervile, to fetch her againe. The old Sachem Papaſiquineo having this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage returned, was inraged? to think that his young ſon in law did not eſteeme him at a higher rate, then to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate with him about the matter, &amp; returne him this ſharpe reply; that his daughters bloud, and birth deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no more reſpect; then to be ſo ſlighted, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he would have her company, hee were beſt to ſend or come for her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:10593:21"/> The younge Sachem not willing to under value himſelfe, and being a man of a ſtout ſpirit, did not ſtick to ſay, that hee ſhould either ſend her, by his owne Convey, or keepe her; for hee was not determined to ſtoope ſo lowe.</p>
                  <p>So much theſe two Sachems ſtood upon tearmes of reputation with each other, the one would not ſend her, &amp; the other would not ſend for her, leaſt it ſhould be any diminiſhing of honor on his part, that ſhould ſeeme to comply, that the Lady (when I came out of the Country) remained ſtill with her father; which is a thinge worth the noting, that Salvage people ſhould ſeeke to maintaine their reputation ſo much as they doe.</p>

I could give maine inſtances to maintaine mine opinion of them in this: But I will onely relate one, which is a paſſage worthy to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:10593:23"/> In the Maſſachuſſets bay lived Cheecatawback the Sachem or Sagamore of thoſe territories, who had large dominions, which hee did appropriate to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Into thoſe parts came a greate company of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, from the territories of Narohiganſet, to the number of 100. perſons; and in this Sachems Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions they intended to winter.</p>
                  <p>When they went a hunting for turkies: they ſpreade over ſuch a greate ſcope of ground, that a Turkie could hardily eſcape them. Deare they killed up in greate abundance, and feaſted their bodies very plentifully:<note place="margin">They trade away beavers ſkinnes for corne.</note> Beavers they killed by no allowance: the ſkinnes of thoſe they traded away at waſſaguſcus with my neighboures for corne, and ſuch other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities as they had neede of; and my neighboures had a wonderfull great benefit by their being in thoſe parts. Yea ſometimes (like genious fellowes) they would preſent their Marchant with a fatt beaver ſkinne, <note place="margin">A beaver ſkinne with his tayle on of great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeion.</note> alwayes the tayle was not diminiſhed, but preſented full and whole: although the tayle is a preſent for a Sachem, and is of ſuch maſculaine vertue, that if ſome of our Ladies knew the benefit thereof, they would deſire to have ſhips ſent of purpoſe, to trade for the tayle alone, it is ſuch a rarity, as is not more eſteemed of, then reaſon doth require.</p>
                  <p>But the Sachem Cheecatawback (on whoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions they uſurped, and converted the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities thereof to their owne uſe, contrary to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keing) not being of power to reſiſt them, practiſed to doe it by a ſubtile ſtratagem. And to that end
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10593:23"/>gave it out amongſt us, <note place="margin">A ſubtile plot of a Sachem.</note> that the cauſe why theſe other Salvages of the Narohiganſets, came into theſe parts, was to ſee what ſtrength we were of, and to watch an opportunity to cut us off, and take that which they found in our cuſtody uſefull for them; And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded further, they would burne our howſes, and that they had caught one of his men, named Meſhebro, and compelled him to diſcover to them where their barnes, Magazines, or ſtorehowſes were, and had take away his corne, and ſeemed to be in a pittifull perplexity about the matter.</p>
                  <p>And the more to adde reputation to this tale, deſires that his wifes and children might be harbered in one of our howſes. This was graunted, and my neighbours put on corſlets, headpeeces, and weapons defenſive and offenſive.</p>
                  <p>This thing being knowne to Cheecatawback, hee cauſed ſome of this men to bring the Narohigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets to trade, that they might ſee the preparation.</p>
                  <p>The Salvage that was a ſtranger to the plott, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply comming to trade, and finding his merchants, lookes like lobſters, all cladd in harneſſe, was in a maze to thinke what would be the end of it. Haſte hee made to trade away his furres, and tooke any thing for them, wiſhing himſelfe well rid of them, and of the company in the howſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Salvage ſcared.</note>But (as the manner has bin) hee muſt eate ſome furmety before hee goe: downe hee ſits, and eats, and withall had an eie on every ſide; and now and then ſaw a ſword, or a dagger layd a thwart a headpeece, which hee wondered at, and aſked his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10593:24"/>guide whether the company were not angry. The guide, (that was privy to his Lords plot) anſwered in his language. that hee could not tell. But the harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Salvage before hee had halfe filled his belly, ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a ſodayne, and ranne out of the howſe in ſuch haſt, that hee left his furmety there, and ſtayed not to looke behinde him who came after: Glad hee was that he had eſcaped ſo.</p>
                  <p>The ſubtile Sachem hee playd the tragedian; and fained a feare of being ſurpriſed; and ſent to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the enemies (as the Meſſenger termed them) were not in the howſe; and comes in a by way with his wifes and children; and ſtopps rhe chinkes of the out howſe, for feare the fire might be ſeene in the night, and be a meanes to direct his enemies where to finde them.</p>
                  <p>And in the meane time, hee prepared for his Ambaſſador to his enemies a Salvage, that had lived 12. moneths in England, to the end it might adde reputation to his ambaſſage.<note place="margin">A Salvage that had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>12.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſent for an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</note> This man hee ſends to thoſe intruding Narohiganſets, to tell them that they did very great injury, to his Lord, to trench upon his prerogatives: and adviſed them to put up their pipes, and begon in time: if they would not, that his Lord would come upon them, and in his ayd his freinds the Engliſh, who were up in armes already to take his part, and compell them by force to be gone, if they refuſed to depart by faire meanes.</p>

                  <p>THeſe people, that have by tradition ſome touch of the immortality of the ſoule, have likewiſe a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to make ſome monuments, over the place where the corps is interred:<note place="margin">Their cuſtom in burryinge.</note> But they put a greate difference betwene perſons of noble, and of ignoble, or obſcure, or inferior diſcent. For indeed in the grave of the more noble, they put a planck in the bottom for the corps to be layed upon; and on each ſide a plancke, and a plancke upon the top in forme of a cheſt, before they cover the place with earth. This done, <note place="margin">Their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</note> they erect ſome thing over the grave in forme of a hearſe cloath, as was that of Cheekatawbacks mother, which the Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth planters defaced, becauſe they accounted it an act of ſuperſtition. Which did breede a brawle as hath bin before related: for they hold impious, and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: to deface the monuments of the dead. They themſelves eſteeme of it as piaculum, and have a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome amongſt them, to keepe their annals: &amp; come at certaine times to lament, <note place="margin">At burrials, they black their faces.</note> &amp; bewaile the loſſe of their freind; &amp; uſe to black their faces, which they ſo weare in ſtead of a mourning ornament for a longer or a ſhorter time, according to the dignity of the perſon: ſo is their annals kept and obſerved with their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed ſolemnity. Afterwards they abſolutely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the place, becauſe they ſuppoſe the ſight thereof, will but renew their ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:10593:27"/> It was a thing very offenſive to them, at our firſt comming into thoſe parts, to aſke of them for any one that had bin dead; but of later times it is not ſo offenſively taken, to renew the memory of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed perſon, becauſe by our example (which they are apt to followe) it is made more familiare unto them; and they marvell to ſee no monuments over our dead, and therefore thinke no great Sachem is yet come into thoſe parts: or not as yet deade, becauſe they ſee the graves all alike.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of their Cuſtome in burning the Country, and the reaſon thereof.</head>
                  <p>THe Salvages are accuſtomed, to ſet fire of the Country in all places where they come; and to burne it, twize a yeare, vixe at the Spring, and the fall of the leafe. The reaſon that mooves them to doe ſo, <note place="margin">The Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges fire the Country twice a yeare.</note> is becauſe it would other wiſe be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with underweedes, that it would be all a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice wood, and the people would not be able in any wiſe to paſſe through the Country out of a beaten path.</p>
                  <p>The meanes that they do it with, is with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine minerall ſtones, rhat they carry about them: in baggs made for that purpoſe of the ſkinnes of little beaſtes which they convert into good lether; carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame a peece of touch wood (very excellent
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10593:27"/>for that purpoſe of their owne making. Theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſtones they have from the Piquenteenes (which is to the Southward of all the plantations in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) by trade and trafficke with thoſe people.</p>
                  <p>The burning of the graſſe deſtroyes the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods, and ſo ſcorcheth the elder trees, that it ſhrinkes them, and hinders their grouth very much: So that hee that will looke to finde large trees, and good tymber, muſt not depend upon the help, of a woodden proſpect to finde them on the upland ground; but muſt ſeeke for them, (as I and others have done) in the lower grounds where the grounds are wett when the Country is fired: by reaſon of the ſnow water that remaines there for a time, untill the Sunne by continuance of that hath exhaled the vapoures of the earth, and dried up thoſe places, where the fire (by reaſon of the moiſture) can have no power to doe them any hurt: and if he would endevoure to finde out any goodly Cedars, hee muſt not ſeeke for them on the higher grounds, but make his inqueſt for them in the vallies, for the Salvages by this Cuſtome of theirs, have ſpoiled all the reſt: for this cuſtome hath bin continued from the beginninge.</p>
                  <p>And leaſt their firing of the Country in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſhould be an occaſion of damnifying us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daingering our habitations; wee our ſelves have uſed carefully about the ſame times; to obſerve the winds and fire the grounds about our owne habitations, to prevent the Dammage that might happen by any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect thereof, if the fire ſhould come neere thoſe howſes in our abſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:10593:28"/> For when the fire is once kindled, it dilates and ſpreads it ſelfe as well againſt, as with the winde; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning continually night and day, untill a ſhewer of raine falls to quench it.</p>
                  <p>And this cuſtome of firing the Country is the meanes to make it paſſable, and by that meanes the trees growe here, and there as in our parks: and makes the Country very beautifull, and commodious.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> That the Salvages live a contended life.</head>
                  <p>A Gentleman and a traveller, that had bin in the parts of New England for a time, when hee retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe in his diſcourſe of the Country, wondered (as hee ſaid,) that the natives of the land lived ſo poorely, in ſo rich a Country, like to our Beggers in England: Surely that Gentleman had not time or leaſure whiles hee was there, truely to informe himſelfe of the ſtate of that Country, and the happy life the Salvages would leade weare they once brought to Chriſtianity.<note place="margin">The Salvages want the art of navigation</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe they want the uſe and benefit of Navigation (which is the very ſinnus of a flouriſhing Commonwealth,) yet are they ſupplied with all manner of needefull things, for the maintenance of life and lifelyhood, Foode and rayment are the cheife of all that we make true uſe of; and of their they finde no want, but have, and may have, them in a moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull manner.</p>
                  <p>If our beggers of England ſhould with ſo much eaſe (as they,) furniſh themſelves with foode, at all ſeaſons, there would not be ſo many ſtarved in the ſtreets, neither would ſo many gaoles be ſtuffed, or gallouſes furniſhed with poore wretches, as I have ſeene them,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:10593:29"/> But they of this ſort of our owne nation, that are fitt to goe to this Canaan are not able to tranſport themſelves, and moſt of them unwilling to goe from the good ale tap; which is the very loadſtone of the lande by which our Engliſh beggers ſteere theire Courſe: it is the Northpole to which the flowre-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce of the compaſſe points; the more is the pitty that the Commonalty of oure Land are of ſuch leaden capacities, as to neglect ſo brave a Country, that doth ſo plentifully feede Maine luſty and a brave, able men, women, and children that have not the meanes that a Civilized Nation hath to purchaſe foode and rayment: which that Country with a little induſtry: will yeeld a man in a very comfortable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; without overmuch carking.</p>
                  <p>I cannot deny but a civilized Nation, hath the preheminence of an uncivilized, by meanes of thoſe inſtruments that are found to be common amongſt civile people, and the uncivile want the uſe of, to make themſelves maſters of thoſe ornaments, that make ſuch a glorious ſhew, that will give a man occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to cry, <hi>ſie tranſit gloria Mundi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſince it is but foode and rayment that men that live needeth (though not all alike,) why ſhould not the Natives of New England be ſayd to live richly having no want of either: Cloaths are the badge of ſinne, and the more variety of faſhions is but the greater abuſe of the Creature, the beaſts of the forreſt there doe ſerve to furniſh them at any time, when they pleaſe: fiſh and fleſh they have in greate abundance which they both roaſt and boyle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:10593:29"/> They are indeed not ſerved in diſhes of plate with variety of Sauces of procure appetite, that needs not there. The rarity of the aire begot by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable quality of the ſweete herbes of the Country, alwayes procures good ſtomakes to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs commend them in this particular, that though they buy many commodities of our Nation, yet they keepe but fewe, and thoſe of ſpeciall uſe.</p>
                  <p>They love not to bee cumbered with many uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilles, and although every proprietor knowes his ownes, yet all things (ſo long as they will laſt,) are uſed in common amongſt them: A biſket cake given to one; that one breakes it equally into ſo many parts, as there be perſons in his company, and diſtributes it. Platoes Commonwealth is ſo much practiſed by theſe people.</p>
                  <p>According to humane reaſon guided onely by the light of nature, <note place="margin">They leade a happy life, being voyd of care.</note> theſe people leades the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and freer life, being voyde of care, which torments the mindes of ſo many Chriſtians: They are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in baubles, but in uſefull things.</p>
                  <p>Their naturall drinke is of the Criſtall fountaine; and this they take up in their hands, by joyning them cloſe together. They take up a great quantity at a time, and drinke at the wriſts, It was rhe ſight of ſuch a feate, which made Diogenes hurle away his diſhe, and like one that would have this principall confirmed. <hi>Natura paucis contentat,</hi> uſe a diſh no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:10593:30"/> I have obſerved that they will not be troubled with ſuperfluous commodities. Such things as they finde, they are taught by neceſſity to make uſe of. they will make choiſe of; and ſeeke to purchaſe with induſtry ſo that in reſpect, that their life is ſo voyd of care, <note place="margin">They make uſe of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things, one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others as common.</note> and they are ſo loving alſo that they make uſe of thoſe things they enjoy (the wife onely excepted) as common goods, and are therein, ſo compaſſionate that rather than one ſhould ſtarve through want they would ſtarve all, thus doe they paſſe away they time merrily, not regarding our pompe (which they ſee dayly before their faces) but are better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their owne, which ſome men eſteeme ſo meanely of.</p>
                  <p>They may be rather accompted to live richly, wanting nothing that is needefull; and to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for leading a contented life, the younger being ruled by the Elder, and the Elder ruled by the Powahs, and the Powahs are ruled by the Devill, and then you may imagin what good rule is like to be amongſt them.</p>

                  <p>Other places have greater quantities in ſo much, as wagers have bin layed, that one ſhould not throw a ſtone in the water, but that hee ſhould hit a fiſh.</p>

                  <p>It is well knowne, they aime at that place, and have a poſſibility to attaine unto the end of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires therein, by meanes, if the River of Mohegan, which of the Engliſh is named Hudſons River (where the Dutch have ſetled: to well fortified plantations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. If that River be derived from the Lake as our Country man in his proſpect affirmes it to be, and if they get and fortifie this place alſo, they will gleane away the beſt of the Beaver both from the French and Engliſh, who have hitherto lived wholely by it, and very many old planters have gained good eſtates out of ſmall beginnings by meanes thereof.</p>

                  <p>The Salvages make report of 3. great Rivers that iſſue out or this Lake 2. of which are to us knowne, the one to be Patomack, the other Canada, and why may not the third be found there likewiſe, which they deſcribe to trend weſtward, which is conceaved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge herſelfe into the South Sea.

                  <p>THis Merchant a man of worth, arrivinge in the parts of New Canaan, and findinge that his Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was diſſolved, ſome of his men ſlaine, <note place="margin">The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant with Supply.</note> ſome dead with ſicknes, and the reſt at Plimmouth; hee was perplexed in his minde about the matter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge as hee did with ſupply, and meanes to have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their fortunes and his one exceedingly and ſeeinge what had happened reſolved to make ſome ſtay in the Plimmouth harbour, and this ſuted to their purpoſe, wherefore the Brethren did congratulate with him at his ſafe arrivall, and their beſt of entertainement for a ſwetning caſt, deploring the diſaſter of his Plantation, and glozing upon the text, <note place="margin">A gloſſe upon the falſe text</note> alledging the miſcheivous intent of the Salvages there, which by freindly intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their neighbours, was diſcovered before it came to be full ſummed: ſo that they loſt not all, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſaved not all: and this they pretended, to proceede from the Fountaine of love &amp; zeale to him; and Chriſtianity, and to chaſtiſe the inſolency of the Salvages, of which that part had ſome dangerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And this as an article of the new creede of Canaan, would they have received of every new commer there to inhabit; that the Salvages are a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous people, ſubtill, ſecreat, and miſcheivous, and that it is dangerous to live ſeperated, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10593:58"/>rather together, and ſo be under their Lee, that none might trade for Beaver, but at their pleaſure, as none doe or ſhall doe there: nay they will not be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to any other ſong yet, of the Salvages to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Plimmouth, becauſe they would have none come there, ſayinge that hee that will ſit downe there muſt come ſtronge: but I have found the Maſſachuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets Indian more full of humanity, then the Chriſtians, &amp; haue had much better quarter with them; yet I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not their humors, but they mine, althoug my great number that I landed were diſſolved, and my Company as few as might be:<note place="margin">Where two nations meet one must rule the other muſt be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or no quietnes.</note> for I know that this falls out infallibly, where two Nations meete, one muſt rule, the other be ruled, before a peace can be hoped for: and for a Chriſtian to ſubmit to the rule of a Salvage you will ſay, is both ſhame and diſhonor: (at leaſt) it is my opinion, and my practiſe was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and I have the better quarter by the meanes thereof. The more Salvages the better quarter, the more Chriſtians the worſer quarter I found, as all the indifferent minded Planters can teſtifie. Now whiles the Merchant was ruminatinge on this miſhapp, the Plimmouth Planters perceivinge that hee had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed himſelfe with excellent Commodities, <note place="margin">A Machivell plot.</note> fit for the Merchandiſe of the Country, (and holding it good to fiſh in trobled waters, and ſo get a ſnatch unſeene) practiſed in ſecret with ſome other in the land, whom they thought apt to imbrace the benefit of ſuch a cheat, <note place="margin">The Vaile.</note> and it was concluded and reſolved upon, that all this ſhipp and goodes ſhould be confiſcated, for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe done by him, the Lord knowes when, or where
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10593:58"/>a letter muſt be framed to them, and handes unto it, to be there warrant, this ſhould ſhadow them; That is the firſt practiſe they will infane a man, and then pretend that Iuſtice muſt be done: They cauſe the Merchant (ſecure) to come a ſhore, and then take him in hold, ſhewing they are compelled unto it legally, and enter ſtrait abord peruſe the Cargazowne, <note place="margin">Shipp and goodes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated.</note> and then deliver up the Charge of her to their Confederates: and how much leſſe this is then Piraty, let any practiſe in the Admiralty be judge. The Merchant, his ſhipp and goodes confiſcated, himſelfe a priſoner, and threatned ſo to be ſent and conveyed to England, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave the ſomme of all that did belonge to him a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor (and a great one to) this hee good man, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with patience, longe time, untill the beſt of all his goodes were quite diſperſed, and every actor his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, the Merchant was inlarged, <note place="margin">When every Conſpirator had his ſhare the ſhipp de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered againe.

The brethren (ſharpe witted) had it ſpread by and by amongſt his freinds in England, that the man was mad. So thought his wife ſo thought his other freindes, that had it from a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Towne. So was it thought of thoſe, that did not know, the Brethren could diſſemble: why thus they are all of them honeſt men in their particular,

                  <p>This harmeles mirth made by younge men (that lived in hope to have wifes brought over to them, that would ſave them a laboure to make a voyage to fetch any over) was much diſtaſted, of the preciſe Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts: that keepe much a doe, about the tyth of Muit and Cummin; troubling their braines more then reaſon would require about things that are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: and from that time ſought occaſion againſt my
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10593:69"/>honeſt Hoſt of Ma-re Mount to overthrow his onder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and to deſtroy his plantation quite and cleane. But becauſe they preſumed with their imaginary gifts (which they have out of Phaos box) they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound hidden miſteries (to convince them of blindnes as well in this, as in other matters of more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence) I will illuſtrate the poem, according to the true intent of the authors of theſe Revells, ſo much diſtaſted by thoſe Moles.</p>
                  <p>Oedipus is generally receaved for the abſolute reader of riddles who is invoaked: Silla and Caribdis are two dangerous places for ſeamen to incounter, neere unto vennice, &amp; have bin by poets formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to man and wife. The like licence the author challenged for a paire of his nomination, the one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting for the loſſe of the other as Niobe for her children. Amphitrite is an arme of the Sea, by which the newes was carried up and downe, of a rich widow, now to be tane up or laid downe. By Triton is the fame ſpread, that cauſed the Suters to muſter; (as it had bin to Penellope of Greece) and the Coaſt lying circuler, all our paſſage to and froe, is made more convenient by Sea, then Land. Many aimed at this marke; but hee that played Proteus beſt and could comply with her humor muſt be the man, that would carry her, &amp; hee had need have Sampſons ſtrenght to deale with a Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lila: and as much patience as Iob that ſhould come there, for a thing that I did obſerve in the life time of the former.</p>
                  <p>But marriage and hanging (they ſay) comes by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteny &amp; Scogans choiſe tis better none at all. Hee that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10593:69"/>playd Proteus (with the helpe of Priapus) put their noſes out of joynt as the Proverbe is.</p>
                  <p>And this the whole company of the Revellers at Ma-re Mount, knew to be the true ſence and expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the riddle: that was fixed to the Maypole, which the Seperatiſts were at defiance with? ſome of them affirmed, that the firſt inſtitution thereof, was in memory of a whore; not knowing that it was a Trophe erected at firſt, in honor of Maja, the Lady of learning which they deſpiſe; vilifying the two univerſities with uncivile termes; accounting what is there obtained by ſtuddy is but unneceſſary learning; not conſidering that learninge does inable mens mindes to converſe with climents of a higher nature then is to be found within the habitation of the Mole.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:10593:70"/> Many threatening ſpeeches were given out both againſt his perſon, and his Habitation, which they divulged ſhould be conſumed with fire: And taking advantage of the time when his company (which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med little to regard, theire threats) were gone up into the Inlands, to trade with the Salvages for Beaver.</p>
                  <p>They ſet upon my honeſt hoſt at a place, called Weſſaguſcus, where (by accident) they found him. The inhabitants there were in good hope, of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion of the plantation at Mare Mount, (which they principally aymed at;) and the rather, becauſe mine hoſt was a man that indeavoured to advaunce the dignity of the Church of England; which they (on the contrary part) would laboure to vilifie; with uncivile termes: enveying againſt the ſacred booke of common prayer, and mine hoſt that uſed it in a laudable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner amongſt his family, as a practiſe of piety.</p>
                  <p>There hee would be a meanes to bringe ſacks to their mill (ſuch is the thirſt after Beaver) and helped the conſpiratores to. Surpriſee mine hoſt, (who was there all alone) and they chardged him, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would ſeeme to have ſome reaſonable cauſe againſt him (to ſett a gloſſe upon their mallice) with criminall things which indeede had beene done by ſuch a perſon, but was of their conſpiracy; mine hoſt demaunded of the conſpirators who it was, that was author of that information, that ſeemed to be their ground for what they now intended. And becauſe they anſwered, they would not tell him, hee as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily replyed, that hee would not ſtay, whether he had, or he had not done as they had bin informed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:10593:70"/> The anſwere made no matter (as it ſeemed) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it had bin negatively, or affirmatively made; for they had reſolved what hee ſhould ſuffer, becauſe (as they boaſted,) they were now become the greater number: they had ſhaked of their ſhackles of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and were become Maſters, and maſterles people.</p>
                  <p>It appeares, they were like beares whelpes in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, when mine hoſts plantation was of as much ſtrength as theirs, but now (theirs being ſtronger,) they (like overgrowne beares) ſeemed monſterous. In breife, mine hoſt muſt indure to be their priſoner, untill they could contrive it ſo, that they might ſend him for England, (as they ſaid,) there to ſuffer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merrit of the fact, which they intended to father upon him; ſuppoſing (belike) it would proove a hainous crime.</p>
                  <p>Much rejoycing was made that they had gotten their cappitall enemy (as they concluded him) whome they purpoſed to hamper in ſuch ſort, that hee ſhould not be able to uphold his plantation at Ma-re Mount</p>
                  <p>The Conſpirators ſported themſelves at my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hoſt, that meant them no hurt; &amp; were ſo joccund that they feaſted their bodies, and fell to tippeling, as if they had obtained a great prize; like the Trojans when they had the cuſtody of Hippeus pinetree horſe.</p>
                  <p>Mine hoſt fained greefe: and could not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded either to eate, or drinke, becauſe hee knew emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines would be a meanes to make him as watchfull, as the Geeſe kept in the Roman Cappitall: whereon the contrary part, the conſpirators would be ſo drowſy, that hee might have an opportunity to give them a

                  <p>The word which was given with an alarme, was, o he's gon, he's gon, what ſhall wee doe he's gon? the reſt (halfe a ſleepe) ſtart up in a maze, and like rames, ran theire heads one at another full butt in the darke.</p>

                  <p>Now Captaine Shrimp, the firſt Captaine in the Land (as hee ſuppoſed,) muſt doe ſome new act to repaire this loſſe, and to vindicate his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who had ſuſtained blemiſh, by this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight.

                     <head>THE ILLVSTRATIONS.</head>
                     <p>NOw to illuſtrate this Poem, and make the ſence more plaine, it is to be conſidered that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at Ma-re-Mount were ſeaven, and they had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads and 14. feete, theſe were accounted Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra with the ſeaven heads; and the Maypole with the Hornes nailed neere the topp, was the forked tayle of this ſuppoſed Monſter, which they (for want of ſkill) impoſed: yet feared in time (if they hindred not mine Hoſt) hee would hinder the benefit of their Beaver trade, as hee had done (by meanes of this helpe) in Kyny back river finely, ere they were a wares; who comming too late, were much diſmaide to finde that mine Hoſt his boate had gleaned away all before they came; which Beaver is a fitt companion for Scarlett: and I beleeve that Iaſons golden Fleece was either the ſame, or ſome other Fleece not of ſo much value.</p>
                     <p>This action bred a kinde of hart burning in the Plimmouth Planters who after, ſought occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mine Hoſt to overthrowe his undertakings, and to deſtroy his Plantation, whome they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted a maine enemy to theire Church and State.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:10593:76"/> Now when they had begunne with him, they thought beſt to proceede: for aſmuch as they thought themſelves farre enough from any controule of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and therefore reſolved to be their owne carvers: (and the father, becauſe they preſumed upon ſome incouragement they had from the favourites of their Sect in England:) and with fire and ſword nine in number purſued mine Hoſt; who had eſcaped theire hand sin ſcorne of what they intended, and betooke him to his habitation in a night of great thunder and lightening, when they durſt not follow him, as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as theſe nine worthies ſeemed to be.</p>
                     <p>It was in the Moneth of Iune, that theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalliſts had appointed to goe about this miſcheifous project, and deale ſo crabbidly with mine Hoſt.</p>
                     <p>After a parly, hee capitulated with them about the quarter, they proffered him, if hee would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to goe for England, there to anſwere (as they pretended) ſome thing they could object againſt him principall to the generall: But what it would be hee cared not, neither was it any thing materiall.</p>
                     <p>Yet when quarter was agreed upon, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wiſe, abuſed him, and carried him to theire towne of Plimmouth, where (if they had thought hee durſt have gone to England) rather then they would have bin any more affronted by him, they would have diſpatched him, as Captaine Shrimp in a rage, profeſt that hee would doe with his Piſtoll as mine Hoſt ſhould ſet his foote into the boate. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the cheife Elders voyce in that place was more powerfull than any of the reſt; who concluded
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10593:76"/>to ſend mine Hoſt without any other thing to be done to him. And this being the finall agreement, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Shrimpe and others,) the nine Worthies had a great Feaſt made, and the furmity po t was provided, for the boats gang by no allowance: and all manner of paſtime.</p>
                     <p>Captaine Shrimpe was ſo overjoyed in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this exployt; that they had, at that time, extraordinary merriment; a thing not uſuall amongſt thoſe preſiſians) and when the winde ſerved, they tooke mine Hoſt into their Shallop; hoyſed Saile, and carried him to the Northen parts; where they left him upon a Iſland.</p>

                  <p>THe Church of Plimmouth having due regard to the weale publike, and the Brethren, that were to come over; and knowing that they would be buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed to make proviſion for the cure of Soules, and therefore might neglect the body for that time: did hold themſelves to be in duety bound, to make ſearch for a fitting man that might be able, (if ſo neede requir'd) to take the chardge upon him in that place of imployment:<note place="margin">A Councell called.</note> and therefore called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell of the whole Synagoge: amongſt which company they choſe out a man, that long time had bin nurſt up in the tender boſome of the Church: one that had
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10593:77"/>ſpeciall gifts: hee could wright and reade, nay more: hee had tane the oath of abjuration, which is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſtepp, yea and a maine degree unto perferment, Him they weane: and out of Phaos boxe fitt him with ſpeciall guifts of no leſſe worth: they ſtile him Doctor and forth they ſend him to gaine imployement and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>
                  <p>What luck is it I cannot hit on his name: but I will give you him by a periphraſis, that you may know him when you meete him next.</p>
                  <p>Hee was borne at Wrington in the County of Somerſet, where hee was bred a Butcher. Hee weares a longe beard, and a Garment like the Greeke that beggd in Pauls Church. This new made Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor comes to Salem to congratulate: where hee findes ſome are newly come from Sea, and ill at eaſe.</p>
                  <p>Hee takes the patient, and the urinall: vies the State there: findes the Craſis Syptomes, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomi natantes: and tells the patient that his diſeaſe was winde, which hee had tane by gapeing, feaſting, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver board at Sea, but hee would quickly eaſe him of that greife, and quite expell the winde. And this hee did performe, with his gifts hee had: and then hee handled the patient ſo handſomely, that hee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of all the winde, hee had in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p>And yet I hope this man may be forgiven, if hee were made a fitting Plant for Heaven.</p>
                  <p>How hee went to worke with his gifts is a queſtion: yet hee did a great cure for Captaine Littleworth, hee cured him of a diſeaſe called a wife: and yet I hope this man may be forgiven, if ſhee were made a fitting plant for heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:10593:77"/> By this meanes hee was allowed 4. p. a moneth, and the chirgeons cheſt, and made Phiſition gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of Salem: where hee exerciſed his gifts ſo well, that of full 42. that there hee tooke to cure, there is not one has more cauſe to complaine, or can ſay black's his eie. This ſaved Captaine Littleworths credit, that had truck'd away the vittels: though it brought forth a ſcandall on the Country by it, and then I hope this man may be forgiven, if they were all made fitting plants for Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But in mine opinion, hee deſerves to be ſet upon a palfrey, and lead up and downe in triumph throw new Canaan, with a coller of Iurdans about his neck, as was one of like deſert in Richard the ſeconds time through the ſtreets of London, that men might know where to finde a Quackſaluer.</p>

                  <p>This man, it ſeemes, played the ſpievery hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely, For in the exerciſe of his guifts on the Lords day at Weenaſimute, <note place="margin">This Caiphas that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> hee eſpied a Salvage come in with a good Beaver coate, and tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reproove the covetous deſire of his auditory to trade for Beaver on thoſe dayes; which made them all uſe ſo much modeſty about the matter for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that hee found opportunity, the ſame day, to take the Salvage a ſide into a corner, where (with the helpe of his Wampampeack, hee had in his pocket for that purpoſe in a readineſſe,) hee made a ſhifte to get that Beaver coate, which their mouthes wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at; and ſo deceaved them all.</p>
                  <p>But ſhortly after, when Ioſua came into the Land, he had ſoone ſpied out Caiphas practiſe; and put him to ſilence; and either hee muſt put up his pipes, and be packing or forſake Ionas poſture, and play Demas part alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>ALthough the nine Worthies had left mine Hoſte upon an Iſland, in ſuch an inhumane manner, as yee heard before; yet when they underſtood that hee had got ſhipping, and was gone to England of his owne accord, they diſpatched letters of adviſe to an Agent they had there: and by the next ſhipp ſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to have a ſnare made, that might hamper mine Hoſt ſo, as hee might not any more trouble theire conſcience: and to that end, <note place="margin">The generall collection made.</note> made a generall collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Beaver to defray the chardge, and hee was not thought a good Chriſtian that would not lay much out, for that imployment.</p>
                  <p>Some contributed three pounds; ſome foure, ſome five pounds, and procured a pretty quantity by that Deviſe, which ſhould be given to a cunning man, that could make a ſnare to hamper him.</p>
                  <p>The Agent (according to his directions,) does his endeavoure (in the beſt manner hee could) to have this inſtrument made: and uſed uo little diligence to have it effected.<note place="margin">Noe coſt ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the getting of a ſkillfull man</note> His reputation ſtood upon the taſke impoſed upon him againſt mine Hoſt, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy (accounted) of their Church, and State.</p>
                  <p>Much inquiry was made in London, and about, for a ſkillfull man that would worke the feate. Noe coſt
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10593:79"/>was ſpared, for gold hee had good ſtore, firſt hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of one: and then another: at the laſt hee heard newes of a very famous man, one that was excellent at making ſubtile inſtruments ſuch as that age had never bin acquainted with.</p>
                  <p>Hee was well knowne to be the man, that had wit and wondrous ſkill, to make a cunning inſtrument, where with to ſave himſelfe, and his whole family: if all the world beſides ſhould be drown'd; and this the beſt, yea and the beſt cheap too; for no good done, the man would nothing take.</p>
                  <p>To him this agent goes, and praies his aide: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his cauſe, &amp; tells the ſubſtance of his greivance, all at large, and laid before his eies a heape of gold.</p>

                  <p>Hee thought perhaps, mine Hoſt (that had the ſlight to eſcape from the nine Worthies, to chaine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus eies, and by inchauntment make the doores of the watch tower fly open at an inſtant) would not be ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perd; but with much a doe: and ſo hee was unwilling to be troubled with that taſke.</p>
                  <p>The agent wondring to ſee that his gold would doe no good, did aſke, the cunning man if hee could give him no adviſe? who ſaid, hee would: and what was that thinke you? To let mine Hoſt alone, who

                  </p>

                  <p>THere was a zealous Profeſſor in the Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan (growne a great Merchant in the Beaver trade) that came over for his conſcience ſake, (as other men have done) and the meanes: (as the phraſe is) who in his minority had bin prentice to a tombe maker; who comming to more ripenes of yeares (though leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,) found a kinde of ſcruple in his conſcience, that the trade was in parte againſt the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: and therefore left it off wholely, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke himſelfe to ſome other imployments.</p>
                  <p>In the end hee ſettled upon this courſe: where hee had hope of preferrement, and become one of thoſe things that any Iudas might hange himſelfe upon, <note place="margin">An Elder.</note> that is an Elder.</p>
                  <p>Hee had bin a man of ſome recconing in his time (as himſelfe would boaſt) for hee was an officer, juſt under the ExChequer at Weſtminſter, in a place called Phlegeton: there hee was comptroller, and converſed with noe plebeians I tell you: but ſuch as have angels for their attendance, (I meane ſome Lawyers, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertenances (that is Clarks,) with whome a Iugg of Beare, and a cruſty rolle in the terme, is as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as a three penny ſcute at Hall time.</p>

                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:10593:84"/> There is another place, thereby called ſticks: theſe are to two daingerous places, by which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall gods doe ſweare: but this of Sticks is the more daingerous of the two, becauſe there, (if a man be once in) hee cannot tell how to get out againe hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely.</p>

Charterparty. Hee diſdained the tenents of the Seperatiſts: and they alſo (finding him to be none,) diſdained to be imployed by a carnall man (as they termed him) and ſought occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt him, to doe him a miſcheife, intelligence was conveyed to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Charterparty, that this man was a member of the Church of England: and therefore (in their account) an enemy to their Church, &amp; ſtate. And (to the end they might have ſome coloure againſt him) ſome of them practiſed to get into his debte; which hee not miſtruſting) ſuffered: and gave credit for ſuch Commodity as hee had ſold at a price. When the day of payment came, inſteede of monyes; hee being at that time ſick and weake, <note place="margin">Good Paye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and ſtood in neede of the Beaver hee had contracted for hee, had an Epiſtle full of zealous exhortations, to provide for the ſoule, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:10593:85"/>not to minde theſe tranſitory things that periſhed with the body; and to be thinke himſelfe whether his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would be ſo prompt to demaund ſo greate a ſomme of Beaver as had bin contracted for. Hee was further exhorted therein, to conſider hee was but a ſteward for a time, and by all likely hood was going to to give up an accompt of his ſtewardſhip: and therfore perſwaded the creditor not to load his conſcience with ſuch a burthen, which hee was bound by the Goſpell to eaſe him of (if it were poſſible) &amp; for that cauſe hee had framed this Epiſtle in ſuch a freindly maner to put him in minde of it. The peruſall of this (lap'd in the paper) was as bad as a potion, to the creditor, to ſee his debtor Maſter Subtilety a zealous profeſſor (as hee thought) to deride him in this extremity, that hee could not chuſe (in admiration of the deceipt) but caſt out theſe words:</p>
                  <p>Are theſe youre members? if they be all like theſe I beleeve the Divell was the ſetter up of their Church.</p>

So that it ſeemes by thoſe proceedings there, the matter was adjudged before he came: Hee onely brought to heare his ſentence in publicke: which was, to have his tongue bored through; his noſe ſlit; his face branded; his eares cut; his body to be whip'd in every ſeverall plantation of theire Iuriſdiction: and a fine of forty pounds impoſ'd with perpetuall baniſhment: and (to execute this vengeance,) ſhackles (the Deacon of Charles Towne) was as ready as Mephoſtophiles, when Doctor Fauſtus was bent upon miſcheife.</p>

                  <p>Though hee be made to ſtay for payment, hee ſhould not thinke it longe; the payment would be ſure when it did come, and hee ſhould have his due to a doite; hee ſhould not wiſh for a token more; And then tould it him downe in ſuch manner, <note place="margin">Notable pay.</note> that hee made Fairecloaths Innocent back, like the picture of Rawhead and blowdy bones: and his ſhirte like a

In this imployment ſhackles takes a greate felitity, and glories in the practiſe of it: This cruell ſentence was ſtoped, in part by Sir Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Gardiner (then preſent at the execution) by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulating with Maſter Temperwell: who was content (with that whipping, and the cutting of parte of his eares) to ſend Innocence going, with the loſſe of all his goods to pay the fine impoſed, and perpetuall ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment out of their Lands of New Canaan in terro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem populi.</p>

                  <p>CHarity is ſayd to be the darling of Religion and is indeed the Marke of a good Chriſtian: But where we doe finde a Commiſſion for miniſtring to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Saints, we doe not finde any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition againſt caſting our bread upon the waters, where the unſanctified, as well as the ſanctified, are in poſſibility to make uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot perceave that the Seperatiſts doe allowe of helping our poore though they magnify their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe incontributing to the nouriſhment of their Saints For as much as ſome that are of the number of thoſe whom they terme without (though it were in caſe of ſickneſſe) upon theire landing, when a little freſh

                     <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of the practiſe of their Church.</head>
                  <p>THe Church of the Seperatiſts, is governed by Paſtors, Elders, and Deacons, and there is not

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10593:87"/>any of theſe (thouh hee be but a Cow keeper) but is allowed to exerciſe his guifts, in the publik aſſembly on the Lords day; ſo as hee doe not make uſe of any notes for the helpe of his memory: for ſuch things they ſay ſmell of Lampe oyle, and there muſt be no ſuch unſavery perfume admitted, to come into the congregation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are all publike preachers. There is amongſt theſe people a Deakoneſſe made of the ſiſters, that uſes her guifts at home in an aſſembly of her ſexe, by way of repetition, or exhortation: ſuch is their practiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Paſtor (before hee is allowed of) muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime his former calling to the Miniſtry, as hereticall; and take a new calling after their fantaſticall inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and then hee is admitted to bee their Paſtor.</p>
                  <p>The manner of diſclaimeing is, to renounce his calling with bitter execrations, for the time that hee hath heretofore lived in it: and after his new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, there is great joy conceaved at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                  <p>And theire Paſtors have this preheminence above the Civile Magiſtrate: Hee muſt firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the complaint, made againſt a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and if hee be diſpoſed to give the partie complained of, an admonition, there is no more to be ſaid: if not; Hee delivers him over to the Magiſtrate to deale with him, in a courſe of Iuſtice, according to theire practiſe, in caſes of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:10593:88"/> Of theſe paſtors I have not knowne many: ſome I have obſerved; together with theire carriage in New Canaan: and can informe you what opinion hath bin conceaved of theire conditions, in the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer. There is one who (as they give it out there, that thinke they ſpeake it to advaunce his worth) has bin expected to exerciſe his gifts in an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that ſtayed his comming, (in the middeſt of his Iorney) falls into a fitt (which they terme a zealous meditation) and was 4. miles paſt the place appointed, before hee came to him ſelfe, or did remember where abouts hee went. And how much theſe things are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the actions of mazed men, I leave to any indifferent man to judge: and if I ſhould ſay, they are all much alike, they that have ſeene and heard, what I have done will not condemme mee altogether.</p>
                  <p>Now, for as much as by the practiſe of theire Church every Elder or Deacon may preach: it is not amiſſe to diſcover their practiſe in that perticuler, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I part with them.</p>
                  <p>It has bin an old ſaying, and a true, what is bred in the bone, will not out of the fleſh, nor the ſtepping into the pulpit that can make the perſon fitt for the imployment. The unfitnes of the perſon undertaking to be the Meſſenger, has brought a blemiſh upon the meſſages,
<note place="margin">Lewes the <hi>11.</hi> ſent a Barber Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.</note> as in the time of Lewes the Eleventh King of France; who (having advaunced his Barber to place of Honor, and graced him with eminent titles) made him ſo preſumptuous, to undertake an Embaſſage to treat with forraine princes of Civile affaires.</p>
                  <p>But what was the iſſue? Hee behaved himſelfe ſo
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:10593:88"/>unworthily (yet as well as his breeding would give him leave) that both the Meſſenger and the meſſage were deſpiſed;<note place="margin">The Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage deſpiſed.</note> and had not hee (being diſcovered) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed himſelfe out of their territories, they had made him pay for his barbarous preſumption.</p>
                  <p>Socrates ſayes, <hi>loquere ut te videam.</hi> If a man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe people in the exerciſe of their gifts, hee may thereby diſcerne the tincture of their proper cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the aſſes eares will peepe through the lyons hide. I am ſorry they cannot diſcerne their owne infirmities I will deale fairely with them; for I will draw their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures cap a pe, that you may diſcerne them plainely from head to foote in their poſtures that ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch (as I may ſpeake with modeſty,) theſe illiterate people to be ſo fantaſticall, to take Ionas taſke upon them without ſufficient warrant.</p>
                  <p>One ſteps up like the Miniſter of Iuſtice with the ballance onely, <note place="margin">A Grocer.</note> not the ſword for feare of affrighting his auditory. Hee poynts at a text, and handles it as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly as hee can; and teaches the auditory, that the thing hee has to deliver; muſt be well waied, for it is a very pretious thing, yet much more pretious then gold, or pearle: and hee will teach them the meanes how to way things of that excellent worth: that a man would ſuppoſe, hee, and his auditory were to part ſtakes by the ſcale; and the like diſtribution they have uſed about a bag pudding.</p>
                  <p>Another (of a more cutting diſpoſition) ſteps in his ſteed; and hee takes a text,
<note place="margin">A taylor.</note> which hee devides into many parts: (to ſpeake truly) as many as hee liſt. The fag end of it hee pares away, as a ſuperfluous remnant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:10593:89"/> Hee puts his auditory in comfort, that hee will make a garment for them: and teach them how they ſhall put it on; and incourages them to be in love with it, for it is of ſuch a faſhion as doth beſt become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man. Hee will aſſuer them that it ſhall be armor of proffe againſt all aſſaults of Satan. This garment (ſayes hee) is not compoſed as the garments made by a carnall man, that are ſowed with a hot needle, and a burning thread; but it is a garment that ſhall out laſt all the garments: and (if they will make uſe of it, as hee ſhall direct them) they ſhall be able (like ſaint George) to terrifie the greate Dragon error; and defend truth which error with her wide chaps, would devoure: whoſe mouth ſhall be filled with the ſhredds, and parings, which hee continually gapes for under the cutting bourd.</p>
                  <p>A third, <note place="margin">A Tapster.</note> hee ſupplies the rome: and in the exerciſe of his guifts begins with a text that is drawne out of a fountaine, that has in it no dreggs of popery. This ſhall proove unto you (ſays hee) the Cup of repentance; it is not like unto the Cup of the Whore of Babilon, who will make men drunk with the dreggs thereof: It is filled up to the brim with comfortable joyce, and will proove a cordiall, a comfortable cordiall to a ſick ſoule, (ſayes hee,) And ſo hee handles the matter as if hee dealt by the pinte, and the quarte with Nic and Froth.</p>
                  <p>An other (a very learned man indeed) goes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way to worke with his auditory;<note place="margin">A Cobler.</note> and exhorts them to walke upright, in the way of their calling, and not (like carnall men) tread awry. And if they ſhould
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10593:89"/>fayle in the performance of that duety, yet they ſhould ſeeke for amendement whiles it was time; and tells them, it would bee to late to ſeek for help, when the ſhop windowes were ſhutt up: and pricks them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a freindly admonition, not to place theire delight in worldly pleaſures, which will not laſt, but in time will come to an end.</p>
                  <p>But ſo to handle the matter, that they may be found to wax better and better, and then they ſhall be doublely rewarded for theire worke: and ſo cloſes up the matter in a comfortable manner.</p>
                  <p>But ſtay: Here is one ſtept up in haſte, and (being not minded to hold his auditory in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any long diſcourſe,) hee takes a text; and (for brevities ſake,) divides it into one part: and then runnes ſo faſt a fore with the matter, <note place="margin">A very pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Well, if you marke it, theſe are ſpeciall gifts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: which the vulgar people are ſo taken with, that there is no perſwading them that it is ſo ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>This is the meanes, (O the meanes,) that they purſue: This that comes without premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: This is the Suparlative: and hee that does not approove of this, they ſay is a very reprobate.</p>

                  <p>If this be one of their guifts, then Machevill had as good gifts as they. Let them raife a ſcandall on any, though never ſo innocent; yet they kow it is never wiped cleane out: the ſtaind marks remaines: which hath bin well obſerved by one, in theſe words of his:
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Stick Candles gainſt a Virgin walls white back:</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>If they'l not burne yet at the least they'l black.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus they dealt with Sir Chriſtopher: and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all the wayes, and meanes they could, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his undertakings in thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I cannot chuſe, but conclude, that theſe Seperatiſts have ſpeciall gifts: for they are given to envy, and mallice extremely.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of their defamacion could not pleaſe the gentleman well, when it came to his eare, which would cauſe him to make ſome reply, (as they ſuppoſed) to take exceptions at, as they did againſt Faire cloath: &amp; this would be a meanes, they thought, to blow the coale, and ſo to kindle a brand that might fire him out of the Country too, and ſend him after mine Hoſt of Ma-re-Mount.</p>
                  <p>They take occaſion (ſome of them) to come to his howſe when hee was gone up into the Country: and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:10593:93"/>finding hee was from home) ſo went to worke, that they left him neither howſe, nor habitation, nor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, nor any thing to help him, if hee ſhould retorne: but of that they had noe hope (as they gave it out) for hee was gone (as they affirmed) to leade a Salvage life; and for that cauſe tooke no company with him: and they, having conſidered of the matter, thought it not fit that any ſuch man ſhould live in ſo remoate a place, within the Compas of their patent. So they fired the place; and carried away the perſons, and goods.</p>
                  <p>Sir Chriſtopher was gone with a guide (a Salvage) into the in land parts for diſcovery: but, before hee was returned, hee met with a Salvage that told the guide, Sir Chriſtopher would be killed: Maſter Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perwell (who had now found out matter againſt him) would have him dead, or alive. This hee related; and would have the gentleman not to goe to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, becauſe of the danger, that was ſuppoſed.</p>
                  <p>But Sir Chriſtopher was nothing diſmaid: hee would on, whatſoever come of it; and ſo met with the Salvages: and betweene them was a terrible ſker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh: But they had the worſt of it, and hee ſcaped well enough.</p>
                  <p>The guide was glad of it, and learnd of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that they were promiſed a great reward, for what they ſhould doe in this imployment.</p>
                  <p>Which thing (when Sir Chriſtopher underſtood,) hee gave thanks to God; and after (upon this occaſion, to ſollace himſelfe) in his table booke, hee compoſed this ſonnet, which I have here inſerted for a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> Of mine Host of Ma-re-Mount hovv hee played Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas after hee had bin in the Whales belly for a time.</head>
                  <p>MIne Hoſt of Ma-re-Mount being put to Sea, had delivered him, for his releefe by the way, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſhipp was unvitteled, and the Seamen put to ſtraight allowance, which could hold out, but to the Canaries) a part of his owne proviſion, being two moneths proportion; in all but 3. ſmall peeces of porke; which made him expect to be famiſhed before the voyage ſhould be ended, by all likelyhood. Yet hee thought hee would make one good meale, before hee died: like the Colony ſervant in Virginea, that before hee ſhould goe to the gallowes) called to his wife to ſet on the loblolly pot, and let him have one good meale before hee went; who had committed a petty crime, that in thoſe dayes, was made a cappitall offence.</p>
                  <p>And now mine Hoſt being merrily diſpoſed, on went the peeces of porke, where with hee feaſted his body, and cheriſhed the poore Sailers: and got out of them what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Wethercock, their Maſter purpoſed to doe with him that hee had no more proviſion: &amp; along they ſailed from place to place, from Iland to Iland, in a pittifull wether beaten ſhip; where mine Hoſt was in more dainger (without all queſtion) then Ionas, when hee was in the Whales belly; and it was the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God that they had not all periſhed. Vittelled they were but for a moneth when they wayd Ancor, and left the firſt port.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:10593:94"/> They were a pray for the enemy for want of powther, if they had met them: beſides the veſſell was a very ſlugg, and ſo unſerviceable, that the Maſter called a counſell of all the company in generall, to have theire opinions, which way to goe, and how to beare the helme, who all under their hand affirmed the ſhipp to be unſerviceable: ſo that in fine the Maſter, and men, and all were at their wits end about it: yet they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Carpenters to ſearch, and caulke her ſides, and doe theire beſt whiles they were in her. Nine moneths they made a ſhifte to uſe her, and ſhifted for ſupply of vittells at all the Iſlands they touched at; though it were ſo poorely, that all thoſe helpes, and the ſhort allowance of a biſket a day, and a few Lymons taken in at the Canaries, ſerved but to bring the veſſell in view of the lands end.</p>
                  <p>They were in ſuch a deſperat caſe, that (if God in his greate mercy had not favoured them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the windes faire untill the veſſell was in Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth roade,) they had without queſtion periſhed; for when they let drop an Anchor, neere the Iſland of S. Michaels not one bit of foode left for all that ſtarving allowance of this wretched wethercock; that if hee would have lanched out his beaver, might have bought more vittells in New England then he &amp; the whole ſhip with the Cargazoun was worth, (as the paſſingers hee carried who vittelled themſelves affirmed,) But hee played the miſerable wretch, &amp; had poſſeſſed his men with the contrary; who repented them of waying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor before they knew ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Mine Hoſt of Ma-re-Mount (after hee had bin in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10593:95"/>the Whales belly) was ſet a ſhore to ſee if hee would now play Ionas, ſo metamorphoſed with a longe voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that hee looked like Lazarus in the painted cloath.</p>
                  <p>But mine Hoſt (after due conſideration of the premiſſes) thought it fitter for him to play Ionas in this kinde, then for the Seperatiſts to play Ionas in that kinde as they doe. Hee therefore bid Wethercock tell the Seperatiſts, that they would be made in due time to repent thoſe malitious practiſes, and ſo would hee too; for hee was a Seperatiſt amongſt the Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts as farre as his wit would give him leave; though when hee came in Company of baſket makers, hee would doe his indevoure to make them pinne the baſket, if hee could, as I have ſeene him. And now mine Hoſt being merrily diſpoſed, haveing paſt many perillous adventures in that deſperat Whales belly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne in a poſture like Ionas, and cryed Repent you cruell Seperatiſts repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouchſafe to thunder, Charter and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Seperatiſts will fall a ſunder: Repent you cruell Schiſmaticks repent. And in that poſture hee greeted them by letters retorned into new Canaan; and ever (as opportunity was fitted for the purpoſe) he was both heard &amp;c ſeene in the poſture of Ionas againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crying repent you cruel Seperatiſts, repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouchſafe to thunder. The Charter and the Kingdome of the Seperatiſts will fall a ſunder: Repent you cruell Schiſmaticks repent; If you will heare any more of this proclamation meete him at the next markettowne, for <hi>Cynthius aurem vellet.</hi>
